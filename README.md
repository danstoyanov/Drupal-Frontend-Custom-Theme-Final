# Drupal Frontend Custom Theme Project ðŸŽ¨

## Overview
This project is dedicated to developing a custom Drupal theme that extends a selected base theme. It is crafted to enhance user experience, providing flexibility and aesthetic appeal, with a variety of dynamic features.

## Features

### Theme Structure
- **Base Theme Extension**: Utilize a base theme of your choice, which will be extended to include additional functionalities.
- **Region Placement**: The theme supports multiple content regions, including a newly defined custom region for enhanced flexibility.
- **Dynamic Header and Footer**: The header will contain the main menu and logo, while the footer will incorporate copyright notices, a social media menu, and potentially a repeat of the main menu.

### Advanced Layout
- **Sidebar Implementation**: Integrate a sidebar for additional navigation or content.
- **Custom Templates**: Create and utilize custom node and field templates employing Twig to handle specific theming needs.
- **Preprocessing**: Data will be preprocessed to add icons before titles and to inject specific classes into the body tag based on node type and ID.

### Styling and Scripting
- **CSS Enhancements**: Develop attractive and responsive CSS to enhance both the appearance and the responsiveness of the theme.
- **JavaScript Integration**: Attach JavaScript libraries as required, optimizing for performance and conditional loading.

### Interactive Features
- **Seasonal Effects**: Implement a library that adds a snow effect to selected nodes, enhancing the thematic elements of the site during winter.
